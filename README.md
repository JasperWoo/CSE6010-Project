##This is the final project of CSE6010 Computational Problem Solving.

**My main contribution** was reading upon googleâ€™s  paper on **MapReduce**, designing **pseudocode** for conducting K-means
clustering using the concept of MapReduce and finally implementing using **OpenMP** task and parallel constructs in C, and finally writing analysis report for the MapReduce part.
