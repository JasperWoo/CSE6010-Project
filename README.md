##This is the final project of CSE6010 Computational Problem Solving.

It implements K-means clustering algorithm with OpenMP task and parallel constructs to optimize performance. We implemented it with two algorithms, one is directly apply K-means algorithm, another made use of Mapper and Reducer concepts. 

**My main contribution** was reading upon googleâ€™s  paper on **MapReduce**, designing **pseudocode** for conducting K-means
clustering using the concept of MapReduce and finally implementing using **OpenMP** task and parallel constructs in C, and finally writing analysis report for the MapReduce part.
