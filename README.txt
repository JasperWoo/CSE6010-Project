This is the final project of CSE6010 Computational Problem Solving.
My main contribution was reading upon googleâ€™s  paper on MapReduce, designing pseudocode for conducting K-means clustering using the concept of MapReduce and finally implementing using OpenMP task and parallel constructs.
Note that the contribution history was erased because I changed my username before the last commit, I will try to recover the history.
